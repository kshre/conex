training was done with 20 epochs
found severe overfitting

The full model is:

Glove 300 MIMIC2 + bi-LSTM char embeddings
                  |
                  V
     2 bi-LSTM layers with DropOut 0.5
                  |
                  V
          1 FC layer DropOut 0.5
                  |
                  V
	Final softmax classifier


Changes planned:
* early stopping - epochs set to 10
* dropout for LSTM internally set to 0.2
